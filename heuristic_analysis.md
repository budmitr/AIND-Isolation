# Heuristic analysis

This brief report describes what kinf of heuristics I used in this project,
their evaluation results in `tournament.py` and overall desicion of taking one
for final submission.

## Heuristics used

### `score_moves`

First and very obvious heuristic is `score_moves` which just counts
available moves of the player and the opponent.
This one is used already in `improved_score` function by default, so I took an
idea from lections to not just use raw differenct, but add some bigger
multiplier for opponent moves: `score = player_moves - opponent_scaling_factor * opponent_moves`.
Values used for tests are `1`, `1.5` and `2`.

### `score_center`

Second heuristic `score_center` is based on the idea that cells closer to center are
more preferable than edge ones -- there is potentially more space to go since 
no board-limits exist.
I used manhattan distance from the very central cell to count the distance.
Because best position gives 0 distance and worst gives 6 and we want heuristic
to return higher values for better moves, I substract distance from maximum value.
Thus, worst value is 0 and the best is 6.
As before, I added scaling factor for opponent moves. Noteworthy is that *I used
scaling for opponent moves for every custom heuristics*.

### `score_freecells`

Third idea is to count all available free cells in a radius of 2 (since knight
move range). If given cell has more open spaces around, consider it better.
This is a bit correlated with number of moves, but is different.
Consider a cell which has only 1 move available (e.g. one near to the corner).
But there is about 5 other cells available so within this little space there
might be more possible moves.
Another cell can have 2 moves and 2 free cells so after moving once game might 
be also over.
This seems better to combine number of moves and number of space. I make it below.

### `score_moves_center`

This one is a combination of `score_moves` and `score_center`.
Scaling factor applied for both heuristics independently and with same value, i.e.
```
def score_moves_center(game, player, opponent_scaling_factor=1):
    if game.is_loser(player):
        return float("-inf")

    if game.is_winner(player):
        return float("inf")

    move_score = score_moves(game, player, opponent_scaling_factor)
    center_score = score_center(game, player, opponent_scaling_factor)
    score = move_score + center_score
    return score
```

### `score_moves_freecells`

Combination of `score_moves` and `score_freecells`.
Scaling factor policy is the same.

### `score_moves_center_freecells`

Ultimate combination of `score_moves`, `score_center` and `score_freecells`
Scaling factor policy is the same.

### `score_combined`

Ultimate combination of `score_moves`, `score_center` and `score_freecells`.
Scaling factor policy is based on previous evaluations of listed 3 heuristics.
Best values used:
* x1.5 for `score_moves` -- 82.86% win ratio (see table below)
* x2 for `score_center` -- 75.00% win ratio (see table below)
* default for ``score_freecells`` -- 77.86% win ratio (see table below)

## Evaluation results

*Default* column means `player_score - opponent_score` for custom heuristics.
Scaling factors 1.5 and 2 noted in corresponding columns *x1.5* and *x2*.
Raw results of `tournament.py` represented in Appendix section.


| **Heuristic**                  | **Default** | **x1.5** | **x2** | **Comments**                            |
|--------------------------------|-------------|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `ID_improved` -- baseline      | 70.00%      |          |        |                                         |
| `score_moves`                  | 72.86%      | 82.86%   | 77.14% | 82.86%: minimal is 14-6 vs AB_Improved  |
| `score_center`                 | 72.14%      | 72.14%   | 75.00% | Not that much good heuristic            |
| `score_freecells`              | 77.86%      | 75.71%   | 75.71% | Almost no difference with scaling       |
| `score_moves_center`           | 70.00%      | 75.00%   | 80.71% | 80.71%: minimal is 12-8 vs AB_Improved  |
| `score_moves_freecells`        | 72.86%      | 73.57%   | 72.14% | Kinda useless combination :(            |
| `score_moves_center_freecells` | 80.00%      | 82.14%   | 80.71% | Stablest heuristic -- always about 80%! |
| `score_combined`               | 72.86%      |          |        | Much worse than separate ones           |


Every custom heuristic is better than baseline, but because of stochastic nature 
I consider results less than 80% as poor ones.
In only 5 cases 80% theshold was passed, 3 times of them by last heuristic -- `score_moves_center_freecells`.
It seems to be best one because of its stability.

## Resulting heuristic and recommendation

Final heuristic `score_moves_center_freecells` with scaling factor 1.5 is choosen for submission based on its results.
Highest value is given by simple `score_moves`, but it is much less stable with different scaling factors.
This high score might be caused by randomness, but `score_moves_center_freecells` seems to be more stable.

Recomendations about evaluation functions usage:
* combine different approaches together, this provides better results as for `score_moves_center_freecells`;
* not implemented here, but is good to test differerent weighting coefficients for such heuristics within a combination;
* based on results, it seems that pushing to choose central cells (as with `score_center`) is useful, other
  evaluation functions are likely to try.
* without scaling factors, `score_freecells` is performing better than `score_moves` -- so counting open area is also
  important. More sophisticated functions, which for example can count open cells within Ð“-distance from each other,
  should be tried.
